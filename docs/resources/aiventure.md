AIventure is an interactive, AI-powered educational game built with Angular, PhaserJS, Gemini, and Gemma 4. It demonstrates how to run a local Gemma 4 model directly in the browser using MediaPipe and WebGPU to power dynamic, agentic non-player characters (NPCs) while introducing concepts in vibe-coding and generative AI.

### How to use this demo

1. Click **Accept and Continue** below to load the demo. The first run downloads and caches a Gemma 4 E4B model in your browser.
2. Navigate the game world and interact with characters to see responses generated locally on your device's GPU.
3. Use the **Full screen** button in the top-left corner of the demo window for an expanded view.

For a deeper dive into the architecture, source code, and step-by-step instructions on building your own agentic game, visit the [AIventure solution page](https://developers.google.com/solutions/learn/aiventure){ data-model="gemma-4" }.

      <p>
        This demo uses Mediapipe with WebGPU to load and run a Gemma 4 model locally. <strong>This will require a 4 gigabyte download</strong> the first time it runs which will then be cached. Performance varies depending on the device's GPU.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> There is some overhead from the browser's WebGPU API which can reduce performance compared to running the model natively via Ollama or LM Studio. Additionally, this model is quantized. Explore this demo and then download the code yourself to compare the performance with LM Studio.
